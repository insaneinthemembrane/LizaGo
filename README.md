# Update

LizaGo Shelved!

**I have decided to shelve the LizaGo project, mainly becaiuse although it is an amazing idea, there is a Liza Elite supposedly coming, so an account on Titter says. How many Lizas do we need? I am not convinced by "Elite", the story sounds fake, but best to avoid getting involved at this time.**

**The below is of use only if I decide to release LizaGo, in which case this section will not be here.**

The cost for 1 LizaGo (LGO) is just 0.00003000 ETH. **Only 2,000,000 (2%) are for sale**. Buying LizaGo now will help towards paying **Yobit Exchange for a listing at the "Exclusive" rate**.

> Upon Yobit listing LisaGo, the remaining tokens, approximately 998,000,000, will be locked in InvestBox. The rate of daily interest will be 6%, which means that LisaGo will have sufficient funds to pay her investors for 5-6 months.

**No more LizaGo will minted during and after this process, making the token a solid investment.**

# Note Well on Gas



> Be aware, there are different gas requirements for ERC20 tokens than there are to ETH itself. Be sure to use enough gas when sending an LGO transaction.
>
> To send ERC20 tokens you must sign a transaction, which uses some itself gas. Gas is sold at a cost per unit price.
>
> TransactionCost = gasUsed * gasPrice
>
> An ERC20 token's gasUsed is "fixed".
>
> If you can make any sense out of this, see: [Ethgasstation](https://ethgasstation.info/predictionTable.php).
